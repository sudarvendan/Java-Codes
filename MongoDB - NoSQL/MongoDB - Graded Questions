What is the total count of orders present in purchases
collection where profit >= 200 and profit <= 3000?

db.purchase.find({$and:[{'Profit':{$gte:200}},{'Profit':{$lte:3000}}]}).count()

What is the maximum value of sales across all the orders?

db.purchase.aggregate([{$group:{_id:null,MaxSales:{$max:'$Sales'}}}])


What is the total number of orders in the purchases collection
whose ‘Segment’ is ‘Home Office’?

db.purchases.find({'Segment':{$in:['Home Office']}}).count()

db.purchase.find({$and:[{'Segment':'Home Office'}]}).count()


What does the following piece of code do? - Wrong.

 Student student = new Student(123, "Abhinav", 356, 28);

 Actual Answer - Yes, it will create a student instance of the
 Student class which will have specifications as student
 name ‘Abhinav’, student ID ‘123’, age ‘28’.

 The code will only create a student instance.
 It will not store it in any Mongo database.



 What will the following Java code do?

String dBName = "upgrad";
String collectionName = "students";
 MongoClient mongoClient = null;
 String connectionString = "mongodb://ec2-3-94-86-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com:27017";


      mongoClient = MongoClients.create(connectionString);
      MongoDatabase db = mongoClient.getDatabase(dBName);
      MongoCollection<Document> collection = db.getCollection(collectionName);

      Document doc = new Document("_id", 141)
          .append("name", "Rahul")
          .append("courseId", 114)
          .append("age", 28);
      collection.insertOne(doc);


The given code will store the details of the student named Rahul
in the students collection in the upgrad database.


When you want to create an index for a collection named
Products using the field Cost in the descending order,
the syntax would be

db.Products.createIndex({Cost:-1})
where -1 indicates that the index would be in descending order.


Match the following actions with their appropriate functions used
in JAVA programming.

a  Finding all the orders from the purchases collection	I deleteOne
b	Adding information about a new order	II	updateOne
c	Removing a document with the order id ‘TEC-17’	III	find
d	Changing the profit value of order ids from 400 to 800 IV	insertOne

a-III, b- IV, c-I, d-II


‘insertOne’ - Used to add a new document in the given collection

‘find’ - Used to find all the documents present in the given collection

‘updateOne’ - Used to update any particular document in the given collection

‘deleteOne’ - Used to delete a document from the given collection

Which of the following syntaxes is used to count the total
number of documents for which profit is less than equal
to 300 in a given collection in a JAVA program?

Note: You can assume that the collection name is purchasesCollection.

MongoDatabase mongoDatabase = mongoClient.getDatabase("products");
MongoCollection<Document> purchaseCollection = mongoDatabase.getCollection("purchases");

purchaseCollection.countDocuments(lte("Profit", 300))



JAVA code for sorting documents
Suppose you want to find all the orders that have a sales
value greater than 500. Then, you want to sort the documents
received in descending order and print them.

List the keywords given below in the order of their occurrence
in a single query.


Collection name

gt

sort

find

descending

Note: You can assume that the database and collection are given as-

MongoDatabase mongoDatabase = mongoClient.getDatabase("products");
MongoCollection<Document> purchaseCollection = mongoDatabase
.getCollection("purchases");


1,4,2,3,5

The query would be as follows:

for (Document document : purchaseCollection.find(gt("Sales", 500))
.sort(descending("Sales"))) {
      System.out.println(document.toJson());
    }

MongoDB
Choose the incorrect option from the options given below.

MongoDB is a document database, where different documents are stored in one collection.


Object data type is used for embedded documents in MongoDB.


There is no ‘Null’ data type in MongoDB.
Feedback:
There is a ‘Null’ data type in MongoDB. This type is used to store a null value.


Object ID data type in MongoDB is used to store the document’s ID.
